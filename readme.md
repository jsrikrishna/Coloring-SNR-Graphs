#Introduction
This document describes the real coded GA for Coloring SNR Graphs and the results obtained.

Assumed wireless multi-hop network as a Graph G, where nodes in the network are represented as Vertices V, and tranmissions links in the graph are represented as Edges E.

**Problem solved to have an efficient Broadcast schedule**



  * **Primary Conflict**
 
 	* Occues when two nodes, which are at a distance of one hop, transmit at same time.
 	
  * **Secondary Conflict**
  	* Occurs when two nodes, whcich are at a distance of two hops, transmit at the same time.
  	
Using a real-coded Genetic Algorithm, an efficient broadcast schedule is acheived. The number of generations in GA depends upon the number of nodes and maximum degree of the graph.
